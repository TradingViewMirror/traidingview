# Contributing to Traidingview

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Traidingview. It's people like you that make Traidingview such a great tool.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
This is one of the easiest and most helpful ways to contribute. If you find a bug, please open an issue and provide as much information as possible, including:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug.
- The expected behavior and what actually happened.
- Your system information (OS, version).

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue. Provide a clear description of your suggestion and why it would be valuable.

### Pull Requests
We love pull requests! If you're ready to contribute code, here's how to get started:

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment.** (We need to add instructions here once we have them).
3.  **Make your changes.** Please follow the existing code style.
4.  **Add/update tests** for your changes.
5.  **Ensure all tests pass.**
6.  **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally.

### Code Style
- Follow the style of the existing codebase.
- (We can add a linter and define rules later).
